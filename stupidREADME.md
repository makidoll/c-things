# ~~F*** JavaScript~~ Learning C
~~> üñ•Ô∏è Time to stop writing JavaScript and to start writing C~~

~~All of these are things I'm making so I can practice writing C.~~

~~I've been using Node.JS for a really long time and I've gotten so used to it, that I didn't even want to use TypeScript. Now that I've read so much about C including "The C Programming Language", I've decided to stop with JavaScript till I'm happy with my new skills.~~

~~I've been using libraries such as Ncurses and SDL!~~

> üñ•Ô∏è Lots of practice writing C! 

After a lot of time with experimenting with C and several higher level languages, I've finally understood that I shouldn't *main* a language, but instead know what to use for the correct job.

I love to use JavaScript for figuring out algorithms and getting things done in the short term. For example, I learnt how to do perspective matracies on a 2D canvas in HTML/JS which in favour has let me understand OpenGL. Now I'm able to port thought-out code into C efficiently as I've done the fun part of figuring something out in a fun language. *Basically C is good after you know you need it and you decide to spend a lot of man-hours with it*

I feel really bad that I swore for my repo name but that reflected how I felt about JS back at the time which I why I'm striking it.
