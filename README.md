# Fuck JavaScript
> üñ•Ô∏è Time to stop writing JavaScript and to start writing C/C++

All of these are things I'm making so I can practice writing C.

I've been using Node.JS for a really long time and I've gotten so used to it, that I didn't even want to use TypeScript. Now that I've read so much about C including "The C Programming Language", I've decided to stop with JavaScript till I'm happy with my new skills.

I've been using libraries such as Ncurses and SDL!
