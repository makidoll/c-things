I don't know what to say other than I like writing C. I had a whole period of my life where I was going through a "what is my main programming language" existential crisis and I renamed README to stupidREADME. Regardless, here's some stuff I've made which I hope you learn from. I'm definitely still learning.

I'll fix up all my makefiles someday and organize the repo better~ ^^

## Highlights
